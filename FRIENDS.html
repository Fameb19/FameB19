      <h4>Be Brave</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Most importantly, true friendship stands for a relationship free of any judgments. In a true friendship, a person can be themselves completely without the fear of being judged. It makes you feel loved and accepted. This kind of freedom is what every human strives to have in their lives.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Importance of Friendship</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Friendship is important in life because it teaches us a great deal about life. We learn so many lessons from friendship which we wonâ€™t find anywhere else. You learn to love someone other than your family. You know how to be yourself in front of friends.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Friendship never leaves us in bad times</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Similarly, friendship also teaches you a lot about loyalty. It helps us to become loyal and get loyalty in return. There is no greater feeling in the world than having a friend who is loyal to you.</p><br>
    
      <h4>person forever.</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">You meet many along the way of life but only some stay with you forever. Those are your real friends who stay by your side through thick and thin. Friendship is the most beautiful gift you can present to anyone. It is one which stays with a person forever.</p><br>
    
      <h4>important for everyone</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">It is important for everyone to have a best friend as they are our well-wishers with whom one can share everything. In other words, it gets tough to share things with your parents or siblings, but with a best friend, we never hesitate. Additionally, they always support us and boost our confidence.</p>
